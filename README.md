# USBaspX

Improved version of an [USBasp](http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/) --
a programmer for AVR's.

Features that it adds compared to USBasp:

 - Two voltage levels: 3.3V and 5V
 - Contains UART communication
 - Can be switched to CDC USB class

## Board

It runs on the original USBasp board,
but it can be also flashed into custom board.
One example is in the repository.
It is very simple to build:
one-sided, big elements, paths and spaces.

## Driver

Attached driver may be not compatible with Windows newer
than XP. Go to http://www.recursion.jp/avrcdc/lowbulk.html
for different driver.
