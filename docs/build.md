# Building

Building WebAssembly modules is not trivial.
It it described in "[Building the WebAssembly module](build-wasm.md)".

Alternatively, if you are not planning to make any changes
in the WebAssembly module, you can download a precompiled version
from GitHub:

```shell
npm run wasm-download [release_tag]
```

The latest release is downloaded by default.
Make sure that you are downloading version compatible with your
sources.
